## Problem Definition
What are the factors that influence customer satisfaction with the company's medicines? This is an 
issue worth addressing by the company as customer satisfaction is a key indicator of the 
effectiveness and value of the company's products. In addition, improved customer satisfaction can 
lead to increased customer loyalty and repeat business, which can have a positive impact on a 
company's bottom line.

## Type of Data Mining
This will be a text-mining task to identify patterns, words, and correlations that may indicate 
which factors are most important to customers and which areas the company could focus on to
improve satisfaction. Data collected provides us with quantitative and qualitative 
data from customer feedback.
